[Latte](https://latte-lang.org/) is originally a JVM language that is fully interoperable with Java.
This project implements a native x64 compiler for this language with no support for interoperability with other languages
but tries to provide an optimized version of native version of this language.

## Running project

Use `make` tool to easily run the defined commands:

- `make latte` compiles project and produces `latc_x86` binary in project directory
- `make test` runs unit tests defined in project
- `make clean` cleans build files

## Compile-time dependencies

- [junit](https://junit.org/junit5/) as testing framework for tests launching and model
- [antlr](https://www.antlr.org/) as parser generator framework (with Gradle plugin)
- [gradle-graal](https://github.com/palantir/gradle-graal) for using GraalVM from Gradle to generate native binaries

## Runtime dependencies

- [nasm](https://www.nasm.us/) to compile assembly code generated by compiler to shared object
- [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) to compile runtime (provided compiled file [runtime.o](./lib/runtime.o)) and link with
  compilation result from nasm
